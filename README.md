# calculator
Hello! This browser version of an electronic calculator was made
using JavaScript and CSS. This project was made in order to
showcase my JavaScript and CSS skills. By using this calculator
a user is able to perform a total of 4 operations: addition,
subtraction, division and multiplication.

Note: The calculator is glitching after the first operation, a fix
in on the way.

This is Project: Calculator from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator

My Project Live: https://alexbean84.github.io/calculator/

GitHub Code Files: https://github.com/alexbean84/calculator

What I learned:
- How to create functions for each mathematical operation
- Create a function that populates the display when a number
button is clicked
- How to save the operation that has been chosen and call a
function on them which throws the result
- How to evaluate a single pair of numbers at a time
